#Day 1- learning different methods to print#
print("This is a print tutorial")
#With printing on multiple lines you can either write 'print' every new line like this#
print("this")
print("first")
print("method")
print("of printing")
print("on every")
print("line")
print("is a bit")
print("tedious")
#or you can just use three quotation marks at the start and end over multiple lines like this#
print("""Anything that starts
with three quotes, and ends
in three quotes can span
many lines and even contain " symbols
within it without freaking anything out and is a lot 
simpler""")
#common mistakes include capitalising commands (print can never be called 'Print'), or not adding enough brackets or quotation marks#
print("I fixed the following code:")
#this is my solution#
print("=MUSIC+=")
print("""> Songs
> Albums""")
print("> Artists")

I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
